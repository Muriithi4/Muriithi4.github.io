  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    I am a bioinformatician with a strong foundation in molecular biology and
    computational analysis, with research interests centered on genomic
    surveillance, antimalarial drug resistance, and population genetics of
    malaria parasites and vectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on the analysis of large-scale genomic datasets to identify
    and interpret genetic variation relevant to infectious disease transmission
    and control. I have experience working with public and field-derived
    datasets, applying statistical analysis, variant profiling, and data
    visualization to extract biologically meaningful insights.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in integrating genomics with epidemiological
    and evolutionary frameworks to support malaria surveillance and evidence-
    based decision-making. My long-term goal is to pursue doctoral training in
    computational and evolutionary genomics, with an emphasis on infectious
    diseases of global health importance.

      Structural and Functional Implications of MIT2 and NT2 Mutations in
      Amodiaquine and Piperaquine Resistant <em>Plasmodium berghei</em>

    <p>
      This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to
      the antimalarial drugs amodiaquine and piperaquine in
      <em>Plasmodium berghei</em>, with a particular focus on mutations arising
      in membrane-associated transporter genes MIT2 and NT2. The project sought
      to determine how these mutations influence parasite fitness, drug
      susceptibility, and transporter protein function.
    </p>

    <p>
      An integrative experimental and computational framework was employed.
      Genetically modified parasite lines with well-characterized resistance
      phenotypes were analysed alongside genomic and sequence-level data to
      identify resistance-associated mutations. Structural modelling and
      functional interpretation were then used to assess the impact of these
      mutations on transporter conformation, stability, and substrate
      interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      By directly linking specific genetic alterations to measurable resistance
      phenotypes, this work provides mechanistic insight into how transporter
      mutations mediate reduced antimalarial drug efficacy. The findings support
      molecular surveillance efforts for antimalarial resistance and contribute
      to the rational design and deployment of effective therapeutic strategies.

      Structural and Functional Impact of the G340S Mutation in

      <em>In silico</em> Analysis and Molecular Docking

    </p>

    <p>
      In the context of identifying resistance markers associated with
      lumefantrine, preliminary experimental work identified a mutation in
      <em>Plasmodium berghei</em> Ferredoxin NADP⁺ Reductase (FNR), G332S, which
      corresponds to the G340S substitution in
      <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. PfFNR is an essential apicoplast-localized
      enzyme involved in critical biosynthetic pathways and antimalarial drug
      activation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To characterise the structural and functional consequences of the G340S
      mutation, this project employed a comprehensive <em>in silico</em>
      bioinformatics pipeline. High-confidence wild-type and mutant PfFNR
      structural models were generated using AlphaFold3 and I-TASSER. Molecular
      docking analyses were performed with AutoDock Vina and AlphaFold3, followed
      by molecular dynamics simulations conducted in GROMACS. Structural
      visualisation and interaction mapping were carried out using ChimeraX.
    </p>

    <p>
      Structural analyses revealed that the G340S substitution alters the
      conformation of the NADP⁺-binding loop, disrupts key hydrogen-bonding
      networks within the cofactor-overlapping region, and reduces predicted
      cofactor-binding affinity, while preserving the overall protein fold.
      These findings provide molecular-level insight into how single-point
      mutations in PfFNR may contribute to altered drug response phenotypes.
